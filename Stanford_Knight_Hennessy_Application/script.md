- why do gerrymandered states have worse public provision?

1. What is gerrymandering? Explanation (packing and cracking), some
   photos/slides

2. Evidence that gerrymandered states have worse public provision. They get
   less federal funding

3. Present idea number one: voter heterogeneity (Supreme Court cite)
4. Present idea number two: lower legislator oversight (Snyder Jr. and
   Stromberg 2010)

5. But in fact, decreased public provision can occur even if representatives'
   actions are perfectly observable and voters have homogeneous preferences
   simply due to non-compact districts:

7. Bargaining and the idea of forming coalitions


We create a novel game—most similar to a repeated multiplayer ultimatum game—to
study the effect of gerrymandering on public provision.  Various mechanisms
have been proposed as to why gerrymandered districts have less public
provision, including voter heterogeneity and lower legislator oversight. Using
an experimental approach, we show that decreased public provision can occur
even if representatives' actions are perfectly observable and voters have
homogeneous preferences simply due to the non-compact districts that
gerrymandering creates. 

 Almost by definition, gerrymandered districts are usually noncompact. This
means that some co-districtors will be very far away from others. This means
that the marginal benefit to funding faraway public services is lower. The
marginal cost per capita is the same, but the marginal cost per electorate is
higher, which makes all the difference. There’s a bit of free-rider thing going
on here as well: people from other districts (who the representatives don’t
care about) benefit from the public hospital they provide.
