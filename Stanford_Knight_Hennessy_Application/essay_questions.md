—- COnnect the dots. How have the influences in your life shaped you ? —-

1: growing up poor, going to the top school, getting a scholarship, doing very well in Oxford bla bla bla...
1: tutoring underprivileged children
1: my political philosophy and economics classes?

What is my shape? 

Believe very strongly in decreasing inequality  (but say it in a more sexy way
—- eugenics ??)


Genetically born smart into a poor family and I MERITOCRACIED my way up. so one
thing is to ensure that the systems are in place and even more robust 

But —- it was largely the luck of the draw that I was born intelligent. It was
also luck that  I had a "tiger mother" who knew that education was very
important and went to great lengths to help me along...

Spent the last of her money to buy  a set of encyclopaedias back when Wikipedia
wasn't a thing. Well-thumbed, taped up, bla bla bla. Very frugal with
everything, but for books, no budget

—> reading about 

Tutoring children made me realise that intelligence/mental
acuity/conscientiousness is genetic/hereditary/innate. There were some kids
that no matter 

Some kids legitimately had ADHD and you could not teach them, while others 

They would never make it to university because they are 

Found some research...

ok, that's fair enough, but just because they were not born smart doesn't mean
they don't deserve a good life. 

So this tempered my view of meritocracy a little bit. In some sense we should
reward merit, but if merit accrues preferentially to smart people, isn't this
unfair?

Political philosophy class —- luck egalitarianism.

But on the other hand, in my ECONOMICS class we learn that people respond to
incentives??? If you do too much welfare, people don't respond well, no
incentive to work?  you still want to reward 

We can giv e welfare, but it definitely feels better to get something from your
own merit rather than be given it. There's a huge joy in being productive and
self-actualising and we need to empower people to do that rather than just give
them money. 

Or—-the zeitegeist of hard work being well rewarded is still incredibly strong
in Singapore, welfare is very unpopular?, deeply consrevative country?

DATA DRIVEN approach to intervention. Don't do what feels good —- do what is
most effective. Behavioural economics nudges

Do i have time to fit in my eugenices?

Rationality, effective altruism

## How will your Stanford education and your Knight-Hennessy Scholars
experience prepare you to realize your intentions?

My stanford education will be in data science and that's going to be incredibly
skill-building. Embryonic genetic selection may not be the most effective
altruist thing to do, but whatever the biggest problems may be one thing is
certain --- computational data analysis is going to be the way forward.

ADvances are going to be computational, they're going to be deep learning. even
if eugenics turns out not to be the most cost effective approach, the data
science skills are still going to be critical.

Need to talk to subject matter domain experts. 

I have some grounding in philosophy, politics and economics. But I need to
speak with lawyers. Need to speak with philosophers. Need to speak with
statisticians and social workers and bioinformaticians and geneticists. I need
to make sure that it is a good idea before I dedicate my life to it. 

The Knight-Hennessey scholars program is going to teach my leadership skills. I
need to cultivate the soft skills needed to convice other people that this is a
godo idea. 

To be empathetic and not dismissive when people come to me with their concerns.
To be patient, yet persistent, in enacting the legislature. 

"Utopian technologoies" --- the internet, electricity, the automobile, the
transistor.
