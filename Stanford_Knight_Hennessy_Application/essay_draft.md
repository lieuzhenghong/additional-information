title: Connect the dots. How have the influences in your life shaped you?

10 years ago the Great Recession happened, and my father's fledgling business went to ruin.

My mother kept me relatively insulated from the brunt of it---she tried to cry when I wasn't around. But this wasn't always possible. I remember coming back one day from school and seeing her distraught and in tears. We didn't have the money to pay my monthly bus fare ($50) to school, and the bus auntie had chewed her out over the phone. I was too young to do anything, but old enough to feel anguish, embarrassment, and helplessness.

There was a lot of crying and shouting. There was talk of divorce, and I know my mother seriously contemplated suicide.  It's difficult to overstate how big an effect this has had on my psyche. My frugality and interest in financial independence stems from this formative event.

Things got better.  My mother found a job as a tour guide, and we are trying to save for her retirement. I tested well in the primary school leaving examinations, and went to a top school where I was given the best education despite my family's circumstances.  I received a full-ride scholarship from the government without which I could not have gone to Oxford.

For this reason, I'm deeply protective of our meritocracy. I believe this is something Singapore does better than any country in the world, and when I return to serve my bond in the civil service, I will ensure that this system stays in place.

But an experience in the army showed me that meritocracy was insufficient.  During my convalescence from a slipped disc I suffered during my service, I taught programming to underprivileged children.  Singapore had just discovered the importance of coding. The government had made multiple official announcements. High schools were giving coveted places to kids who could code. Enterprising, expensive tuition centers were offering coding lessons to give one's children a headstart---but only to those who could pay.

I was incensed at this backsliding of our meritocracy. Rich kids learn programming but poor kids don't even have computers! So I developed a Python curriculum and approached many charities. One prescient lady, Mrs Hauw, agreed.

I tutored twenty-five underprivileged children weekly using my curriculum. We procured second-hand laptops through donations from various companies.  I realised that my curriculum was too ambitious for most of them. But four showed remarkable potential, devouring the material. Mrs Hauw suggested I take them aside and coach them for a national hackathon, to give them something to strive for, to help their high school admissions, and to banish their inferiority complex stemming from their poverty.

They took first and third out of over 150 teams. I was incredibly proud of them: they stood their own against much more privileged children, many of whom attended those expensive private enrichment centers. One of them has now gone to a STEM magnet school.

Despite the happy tale, my experience has tempered my understanding of meritocracy. Meritocracy fetes achievement irrespective of one's background.  But what if one's achievements are determined by luck? Many of the children I taught had learning disabilities. Some had ADHD, others poor emotional control (which caused them to shout at, and hit, their tutors).  I did the research and realised that many of these disabilities have a genetic and environmental basis. It is nobody's fault---just the luck of the draw.  I am a grateful beneficiary of the meritocratic system. I think I deserve it because I work hard and have done well. But I had two huge advantages that I did not deserve:

I was lucky to be born intelligent. I was lucky to have had a "tiger mom" who spared no expense to further my education. My mother spent the last of her savings to buy me two volumes of well-thumbed encyclopaediae. Money was incredibly tight, but if I wanted any book, she would get it.

In the same way, the four children I helped only needed a bit of support to thrive. But what about the other two dozen?  Meritocracy can help people like me and the four children who win the genetic lottery and have supportive home environments. But it can't ever help those whose mother smoked and drank when they were *in utero*, for instance.  This is a deeply unpopular view. The current zeitgeist downplays individual genetic differences. Genetics isn't the be-all-end-all, but the weight of the evidence can't be ignored. Getting this right has huge consequences for policy!

I still believe meritocracy is just, but only if we reduce genetic and environmental inequality. Therefore, I want to explore government-subsidised gene therapy and embryonic genetic selection to give everyone a fair shake.  There are lots of promising poverty reduction programs, and I want to use RCTs to find the best ones.

To the admissions office: thank you for letting me tell this tale. It was hard to access these dormant memories, but in the process of writing they rose unbidden to my mind.
